Each sample comes in two files: one *.tsv file containing the data in a valid
DSR format and an *.xsls file for human consumption.

Note: there are currently only samples for Multi-Record Block Variants (MRBV)
available. Single-Record Block Variant (SRBV) samples will follow in due course.

There are also no samples available for Parts 6 (Royalty Reporting) and 11 
(Basic Audio Profile for the Mechanical Licensing Collective).
